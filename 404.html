    "<p>every day feels like a blank page<br/>I stare into emptiness<br/>as words fly into one ear<br/>and out the other<br/>always telling myself<br/>that I'll make something<br/>out of each new page I am given<br/>that I might fold it into something new<br/>but I'm always too afraid I might mess up<br/>the structured square that is my life.<br/> —— Katie</p>",
    "<p>When I call out<br/>into the nothingness of my bleak existence,<br/>I desperately scream one thing:<br/>&quot;Marco...&quot;<br/> —— Chris Bee</p>",
    "<p>When did we get lost?<br/>Wasn't it you who taught me everything?<br/>Why was I so afraid to love you?<br/><br/>When there's a will there's a way.<br/>That's what you taught me.<br/>I'm trying to live up to your expectation<br/>but you always gave me a choice.<br/> —— Charlie Wonder</p>",

    "<p>I want<br/>a quiet mind.<br/>A slice of space time<br/>carved out, specifically mine.<br/>I lost and found fullness in the void.<br/>The promise of isolated existence,<br/>of a transcendent world where I forget.<br/> —— Aspen Welsch</p>"
